### Week 7
We took a short [quiz](quiz-write-a-function.md)! On functions.

We also talked through function syntax and about where variables live (i.e. scope).

### Week 8
We made [a clock](http://codepen.io/sansumbrella/pen/RNPRoK). In the process, we wrote a series of in-line instructions, then went back and wrapped them in functions to make our code reusable.

A peek at libraries.
Show/hide with javascript, with and without jQuery.
