# Week One

Self-learning material:

How to Make a Website (Treehouse)

I think it will take about two weeks to go through this section of the Treehouse materials. As we go along, we will decide which additional Treehouse content to use and where to supplement with other resources.

## Introductions

### What am I doing here?

I’m here to help you reach your goals in web development.

I have a background in architecture and design. I write software for interactive installations and real-time graphics for a living.

[My website](http://sansumbrella.com/) will give you an idea of the kind of work I do.

I will:
- Share current web things I find interesting (workflows, websites, technologies, concepts).
- Listen to your questions.
- Help you navigate self-learning materials to pick the most helpful ones.
- Lead short demos based on your questions.

### What are you doing here?

Hopefully, you already have some idea of what you want to get out of this. Maybe you want to get a job as a web developer. Maybe you want to make a website for your parrot.

If you don’t know what you are doing here, that is okay. Being exposed to new ideas and how websites work will give you plenty of opportunities to find what is interesting about it to you.

Questions for everyone:
- What brought you here?
- If you could make a website for anything, what would it be?
- What is front-end web development? (not a trick question!)

You will:
- Go through learning materials during the week.
- Try new things.
- Bring in questions (how-to, what-if, why).
- Help each other.

### We are Inclusive

Together we will create an inclusive learning environment. All points of view are welcome. Disparaging or harassing comments will not be tolerated.

## What is front-end web development, anyway?

Front-end web development covers a range from basic design to programming interactive content. It is all the techniques of assembling media to deliver content over the web.

[Insert class ideas here]

### How do we learn it?

By doing. The first Treehouse section in the Front-End Web Development track has you follow along to build a website. We will all do that first, then progress into some of the details by iterating over small projects of our own. At that point, the Treehouse videos will be more useful as a reference when you run into challenges making the things you want to make.
